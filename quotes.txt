-IDLE THOUGHTS OF AN IDLE FELLOW,
-STAGE LAND,
-premonitory symptoms,
-walk the hospitals,
-What a doctor wants,
-is practice. He shall have me. He will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each.
-Well, what’s the matter with you?
-I will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the matter with me. Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had finished. But I will tell you what is _not_ the matter with me. I have not got housemaid’s knee. Why I have not got housemaid’s knee, I cannot tell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it. Everything else, however, I _have_ got.
-You are a chemist?
-I am a chemist. If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel combined, I might be able to oblige you. Being only a chemist hampers me.
-a general disinclination to work of any kind.
-Why, you skulking little devil, you,
-get up and do something for your living, can’t you?
-What we want is rest,
-Rest and a complete change,
-The overstrain upon our brains has produced a general depression throughout the system. Change of scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the mental equilibrium.
-No,
-if you want rest and change, you can’t beat a sea trip.
-Sea-side!
-why, you’ll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as for exercise! why, you’ll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship, than you would turning somersaults on dry land.
-What can I get you, sir?
-Get me out of this,
-There she goes,
-there she goes, with two pounds’ worth of food on board that belongs to me, and that I haven’t had.
-Hi! come further in,
-You’ll be overboard.
-Oh my! I wish I was,
-Good sailor!
-well, I did feel a little queer _once_, I confess. It was off Cape Horn. The vessel was wrecked the next morning.
-Weren’t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be thrown overboard?
-Southend Pier!
-Yes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.
-Oh, ah—yes,
-I remember now. I did have a headache that afternoon. It was the pickles, you know. They were the most disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat. Did _you_ have any?
-Let’s go up the river.
-T.
-T
-T
-It’s all very well for you fellows,
-you like it, but _I_ don’t. There’s nothing for me to do. Scenery is not in my line, and I don’t smoke. If I see a rat, you won’t stop; and if I go to sleep, you get fooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard. If you ask me, I call the whole thing bally foolishness.
-camping-out,
-camp out
-Good-night,
-How about when it rained?
-weeps, he knows not why.
-Hark! do you not hear? Is it but the mermaids singing deep below the waving waters; or sad spirits, chanting dirges for white corpses, held by seaweed?
-I know what it is, old man; you’ve got a chill. Now, you come along with me. I know a place round the corner here, where you can get a drop of the finest Scotch whisky you ever tasted—put you right in less than no time.
-So glad you’ve come, old fellow; I’ve found a nice place round the corner here, where you can get some really first-class nectar.
-Here! what are you up to?
-What are _you_ up to?
-leggo, can’t you?
-Don’t pull it; you’ve got it all wrong, you stupid ass!
-No, I haven’t,
-let go your side!
-I tell you you’ve got it all wrong!
-Ah, the bally idiot!
-There you are! what did I tell you?
-Oh, it’s you, is it?
-Yes,
-what’s happened?
-Bally tent’s blown down, I think,
-Where’s Bill?
-Bill!
-Get off my head, can’t you?
-Oh, that dog will never live. He will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot, that is what will happen to him.
-life;
-Now, the first thing to settle is what to take with us. Now, you get a bit of paper and write down, J., and you get the grocery catalogue, George, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, and then I’ll make out a list.
-Oh, you leave that to _me_. Don’t you, any of you, worry yourselves about that. _I’ll_ do all that.
-Now you go and get me my hammer, Will,
-and you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the step-ladder, and I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you run round to Mr. Goggles, and tell him, ‘Pa’s kind regards, and hopes his leg’s better; and will he lend him his spirit-level?’ And don’t you go, Maria, because I shall want somebody to hold me the light; and when the girl comes back, she must go out again for a bit of picture-cord; and Tom!—where’s Tom?—Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me up the picture.
-Doesn’t anybody in the whole house know where my coat is? I never came across such a set in all my life—upon my word I didn’t. Six of you!—and you can’t find a coat that I put down not five minutes ago! Well, of all the—
-Oh, you can give it up! I’ve found it myself now. Might just as well ask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it.
-There!
-now the nail’s gone.
-Where’s the hammer? What did I do with the hammer? Great heavens! Seven of you, gaping round there, and you don’t know what I did with the hammer!
-Oh! you women, you make such a fuss over everything,
-Why, I _like_ doing a little job of this sort.
-There you are,
-Why, some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like that!
-No; _you_ get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, and George write down, and I’ll do the work.
-You know we are on a wrong track altogether. We must not think of the things we could do with, but only of the things that we can’t do without.
-We won’t take a tent,
-we will have a boat with a cover. It is ever so much simpler, and more comfortable.
-Oh! Ugh!
-No, not exactly himself like; but he knew some fellows who had, and it was easy enough;
-Begin with breakfast.
-a tea-pot and a kettle, and a methylated spirit stove.
-No oil,
-never again.
-Oh, with pleasure, dear boy,
-with pleasure.
-Very close in here,
-Quite oppressive,
-What’s yours?
-I’ll have half-a-crown’s worth of brandy, neat, if you please, miss,
-Here y’ are, Maria; come along, plenty of room.
-All right, Tom; we’ll get in here,
-What is it? Tell me the worst.
-It’s cheeses. Tom bought them in Liverpool, and asked me to bring them up with me.
-What did Tom say about those cheeses?
-Nobody’s likely to touch them. Had he smelt them?
-You think he would be upset,
-if I gave a man a sovereign to take them away and bury them?
-Do you mind keeping them for him? Let me send them round to you.
-Madam,
-for myself I like the smell of cheese, and the journey the other day with them from Liverpool I shall ever look back upon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday. But, in this world, we must consider others. The lady under whose roof I have the honour of residing is a widow, and, for all I know, possibly an orphan too. She has a strong, I may say an eloquent, objection to being what she terms ‘put upon.’ The presence of your husband’s cheeses in her house she would, I instinctively feel, regard as a ‘put upon’; and it shall never be said that I put upon the widow and the orphan.
-Very well, then,
-all I have to say is, that I shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are eaten. I decline to live any longer in the same house with them.
-What smell?
-We shan’t want any tea,
-but we’ll have a good round, square, slap-up meal at seven—dinner, tea, and supper combined.
-Oh, you—!
-There you are, simple enough!
-Ain’t you going to put the boots in?
-I’ll take my oath I put it down on that chair,
-I saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,
-Most extraordinary thing I ever heard of,
-So mysterious!
-Why, here it is all the time,
-Where?
-Stand still, can’t you!
-Do you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?
-What time shall I wake you fellows?
-Seven.
-No—six,
-Wake us at 6.30, George,
-weather forecast
-Do you know that it’s nearly nine o’clock, sir?
-Nine o’ what?
-Nine o’clock,
-I thought you was a-oversleeping yourselves.
-I thought you wanted to get up at six?
-So I did,
-why didn’t you wake me?
-How could I wake you, when you didn’t wake me?
-Now we shan’t get on the water till after twelve. I wonder you take the trouble to get up at all.
-Um,
-lucky for you that I do. If I hadn’t woke you, you’d have lain there for the whole fortnight.
-Wasermarrer?
-Get up, you fat-headed chunk!
-It’s quarter to ten.
-What!
-Who the thunder put this thing here?
-Don’t be absurd. How can I go into the City like this?
-The great thing is to make a good breakfast,
-rain, cold, wet to fine
-occasional local thunder-storms, east wind, with general depression over the Midland Counties (London and Channel). Bar. falling.

-forecasts
-Heavy showers, with thunderstorms, may be expected to-day,
-Ah!
-won’t they come home soaked!
-Ah! they’ll come in the afternoon, you’ll find,
-Oh, _won’t_ those people get wet. What a lark!
-No, no,
-not we. _We_ don’t mean to get wet—no, no.
-warm, fine to set-fair day; much heat;
-set fair.
-very dry.

-Oh no, sir, I think it will clear up all right. It will break all right enough, sir.
-Ah, he knows
-wonderful how these old fellows can tell!
-Ah, well,
-he did his best.
-Going to clear up, d’ye think?
-Well, no, sir; I’m afraid it’s settled down for the day,
-Stupid old fool!
-what’s _he_ know about it?
-Bar. falling,
-pressure increasing,
-Hi! ground floor o’ 42’s a-moving.
-The Blue Posts
-They ain’t a-going to starve, are they?
-Ah! you’d want to take a thing or two with _you_,
-if you was a-going to cross the Atlantic in a small boat.
-They ain’t a-going to cross the Atlantic,
-they’re a-going to find Stanley.
-Nobody will ever know, on this line,
-what you are, or where you’re going. You know the way, you slip off quietly and go to Kingston.
-Well, I don’t know, gents,
-but I suppose _some_ train’s got to go to Kingston; and I’ll do it. Gimme the half-crown.
-Are you all right, sir?
-Right it is,
-Kyningestun,

-Harris had a glass of bitter in this house;
-Harris was chucked from here in December, 1886.
-Only house in South London that Harris never had a drink in!
-What Ferry, ho! Gadzooks, gramercy.
-when men knew how to build.
-Oak,
-All carved oak, right up to the ceiling, just the same as you saw on the staircase.
-But, great Cæsar! man,
-you don’t mean to say you have covered over carved oak with blue wall-paper?
-Yes,
-it was expensive work. Had to match-board it all over first, of course. But the room looks cheerful now. It was awful gloomy before.
-old blue
-those grand old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century, and produced those china dogs.
-sampler
-Souvenirs of Margate,
-Hulloa! what’s that for?
-What’s that for? Why—
-We’ll just go in here, so that you can say you’ve been, but it’s very simple. It’s absurd to call it a maze. You keep on taking the first turning to the right. We’ll just walk round for ten minutes, and then go and get some lunch.
-Oh, one of the largest in Europe,
-Yes, it must be,
-because we’ve walked a good two miles already.
-Oh, impossible!
-Not at all,
-The map may be all right enough,
-if you know whereabouts in it we are now.
-boating costume,
-boating costumes
-I beg your pardon, I’m sure;
-Oh, it’s of no consequence,
-Now then, you girls,
-come along, you’ve got to wash up!
-Oh, I’ll soon show you,
-it’s rare fun! You lie down on your—I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and sloush the things about in the water.
-Oh, they’ll be all right,
-tuck ’em up.
-Who is Mrs. Thomas?
-How should I know?
-She’s a lady that’s got a funny tomb, and I want to see it.
-All right, sur, I’m a-coming, I’m a-coming. It’s all right, sur; don’t you be in a hurry.
-I’m a-coming, sur, I’m a-coming. I’m a little lame. I ain’t as spry as I used to be. This way, sur.
-Go away, you miserable old man,
-I’ve come as soon as I could, sur,
-My missis never see you till just this minute. You follow me, sur.
-Go away,
-leave me before I get over the wall, and slay you.
-Don’t you want to see the tombs?
-No,
-I don’t. I want to stop here, leaning up against this gritty old wall. Go away, and don’t disturb me. I am chock full of beautiful and noble thoughts, and I want to stop like it, because it feels nice and good. Don’t you come fooling about, making me mad, chivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense of yours. Go away, and get somebody to bury you cheap, and I’ll pay half the expense.
-Yuise a stranger in these parts? You don’t live here?
-No,
-I don’t. _You_ wouldn’t if _I_ did.
-Well then,
-you want to see the tombs—graves—folks been buried, you know—coffins!
-You are an untruther,
-I do not want to see tombs—not your tombs. Why should I? We have graves of our own, our family has. Why my uncle Podger has a tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery, that is the pride of all that country-side; and my grandfather’s vault at Bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors, while my great-aunt Susan has a brick grave in Finchley Churchyard, with a headstone with a coffee-pot sort of thing in bas-relief upon it, and a six-inch best white stone coping all the way round, that cost pounds. When I want graves, it is to those places that I go and revel. I do not want other folk’s. When you yourself are buried, I will come and see yours. That is all I can do for you.
-Well, won’t you come and see the memorial window?
-I’ve got a couple of skulls down in the crypt,
-come and see those. Oh, do come and see the skulls! You are a young man out for a holiday, and you want to enjoy yourself. Come and see the skulls!
-Oh, come and see the skulls; come back and see the skulls!
-I never see him doing any work there,
-whenever I go in. He sits behind a bit of glass all day, trying to look as if he was doing something. What’s the good of a man behind a bit of glass? I have to work for my living. Why can’t he work? What use is he there, and what’s the good of their banks? They take your money, and then, when you draw a cheque, they send it back smeared all over with ‘No effects,’ ‘Refer to drawer.’ What’s the good of that? That’s the sort of trick they served me twice last week. I’m not going to stand it much longer. I shall withdraw my account. If he was here, we could go and see that tomb. I don’t believe he’s at the bank at all. He’s larking about somewhere, that’s what he’s doing, leaving us to do all the work. I’m going to get out, and have a drink.
-such-like Sunday-school slops,
-Notice
-Not a bit of it. Serve ’em all jolly well right, and I’d go and sing comic songs on the ruins.
-Well, I can only sing a _comic_ song, you know;
-Oh, that _is_ nice,
-Do sing one, Mr. Harris;
-Now, silence, please, everybody
-Mr. Harris is going to sing a comic song!
-Oh, how jolly!
-I’m afraid it’s a very old thing, you know. I expect you all know it, you know. But it’s the only thing I know. It’s the Judge’s song out of _Pinafore_—no, I don’t mean _Pinafore_—I mean—you know what I mean—the other thing, you know. You must all join in the chorus, you know.
-_Trial by Jury_
-_Trial by Jury_,
-It’s all right. You’re doing it very well, indeed—go on.
-I’m afraid there’s a mistake somewhere. What are you singing?
-Why the Judge’s song out of Trial by Jury. Don’t you know it?
-No, you’re not, you chuckle-head, you’re singing the Admiral’s song from _Pinafore_.
-‘When I was young and called to the Bar.’
-Now then, old man, you start off, and I’ll follow. We won’t bother about any prelude.
-It is too low, old man; we’ll have that over again, if you don’t mind.
-And he diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-dee’d, Till now he is the ruler of the Queen’s navee.
-Oh, it will amuse you. You will laugh,
-scold’s bridle
-Corway Stakes
-What’s that?
-a frying-pan?
-No,
-they are all the rage this season; everybody has got them up the river. It’s a banjo.
-I never knew you played the banjo!
-Not exactly,
-but it’s very easy, they tell me; and I’ve got the instruction book!
-Ah! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change; change is good for everyone. Out you get!
-What have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-net of it? You’ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn’t you wind it up properly, you silly dummy?
-It was all right when you took it!
-Why don’t you think what you are doing? You go about things in such a slap-dash style. You’d get a scaffolding pole entangled _you_ would!
-Why, our boat’s gone off!
-We just got out to disentangle the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was gone!
-Hi! stop a minute, will you?
-I’ve dropped my hat over-board.
-Hi! Tom—Dick! can’t you hear?
-Hi! Confound _you_, you dunder-headed idiots! Hi! stop! Oh you—!
-Oh, Henry, then _where_ is auntie?
-Did they ever recover the old lady?
-I should like to see him pull the wrong line,
-Oh, look!
-he’s gone right out into the middle.
-Yes. What’s the matter?
-Don’t stop,
-Don’t what?
-Don’t stop—go on—go on!
-Go back, Emily, and see what it is they want,
-What do you want?
-anything happened?
-No,
-it’s all right; only go on, you know—don’t stop.
-Why not?
-Why, we can’t steer, if you keep stopping. You must keep some way on the boat.
-Keep some what?
-Some way—you must keep the boat moving.
-Oh, all right, I’ll tell ’em. Are we doing it all right?
-Oh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don’t stop.
-It doesn’t seem difficult at all. I thought it was so hard.
-Oh, no, it’s simple enough. You want to keep on steady at it, that’s all.
-I see. Give me out my red shawl, it’s under the cushion.
-Oh, it’s all right!
-We’ll be through the next lock before seven, and then there is only one more;
-Oh!
-No,
-I can’t see any signs of a lock.
-You—you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?
-You don’t think we have lost our way, do you?
-He’s got ’em on,
-He’s got ’em on,
-Wallingford lock!
-Lor’ love you, sir, that’s been done away with for over a year. There ain’t no Wallingford lock now, sir. You’re close to Cleeve now. Blow me tight if ’ere ain’t a gentleman been looking for Wallingford lock, Bill!
-Picnic Point,
-Give us a hand here, can’t you, you cuckoo; standing there like a stuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffocated, you dummy!
-I don’t want any tea; do you, George?
-Oh, no, I don’t like tea; we’ll have lemonade instead—tea’s so indigestible.
-Ah!
-Ah!
-Ah!
-Work!
-Now, rise, and show your strength. Be eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear eye, into Nature and into life; spread your white wings of quivering thought, and soar, a god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!
-Be dull and soulless, like a beast of the field—a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any ray of fancy, or of hope, or fear, or love, or life.
-Now, come, fool, grin and tumble, that your fellow-men may laugh—drivel in folly, and splutter in senseless sounds, and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are drowned, like kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.
-Steady, old man; ’ware wheat.
-Oh, I’m so sorry, old chap; I hope I haven’t hurt you.
-Not at all;
-Joe!
-What’s the matter, Tom?
-Why, there’s a man in my bed,
-here’s his feet on my pillow.
-Well, it’s an extraordinary thing, Tom,
-but I’m blest if there isn’t a man in my bed, too!
-What are you going to do?
-Well, I’m going to chuck him out,
-So am I,
-I say, Tom!
-Yes!
-How have you got on?
-Well, to tell you the truth, my man’s chucked _me_ out.
-So’s mine! I say, I don’t think much of this inn, do you?
-What was the name of that inn?
-The Pig and Whistle,
-Why?
-Ah, no, then it isn’t the same,
-What do you mean?
-Why it’s so curious,
-but precisely that very same thing happened to _my_ father once at a country inn. I’ve often heard him tell the tale. I thought it might have been the same inn.
-Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
-and here have I got to be in the City by nine. Why didn’t somebody call me? Oh, this is a shame!
-What’s the time?
-why, if you listen you will hear it strike.
-But it’s only gone three!
-Well, and how many did you want it to go?
-Why, nine,
-Do you know where you live?
-Oh! that’s where it is, is it?
-well, you take my advice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours with you; and don’t let’s have any more of it.
-Nothing,
-Police!
-Well, who’s going to be first in?
-By Jove! old J.’s gone in,
-I didn’t think he’d have the pluck to do it. Did you?
-Is it all right?
-Lovely,
-You are duffers not to come in. I wouldn’t have missed this for worlds. Why won’t you try it? It only wants a little determination.
-Ar’n’t you—you—going to get it out?
-It isn’t my shirt—it’s _yours_!
-What!
-You silly cuckoo! Why can’t you be more careful what you’re doing? Why the deuce don’t you go and dress on the bank? You’re not fit to be in a boat, you’re not. Gimme the hitcher.
-Runningmede,
-Oh!
-I didn’t know anybody was here.
-Oh! didn’t you?
-It’s very dark. Why don’t you light the gas?
-Oh!
-Oh!
-You don’t say so!
-Why don’t they have a special room for this sort of thing, and make people keep to it?
-Oh! you here!
-Oh, I’m so glad to see you! Isn’t it funny? I’ve just met Mr. Henry VIII. in the lane, and he’s going the same way I am.
-Oh! we’d better get out of here while this billing and cooing is on. We’ll go down to Kent.
-Oh, drat this!
-Here, let’s go away. I can’t stand any more of it. Let’s go to St. Albans—nice quiet place, St. Albans.
-Bells of Ouseley,
-If I am guilty,
-may this bread choke me when I eat it!
-Oh, don’t let’s go in there! Let’s go on a bit further, and see if there isn’t one with honeysuckle over it.
-Why, you are coming away from them. You must turn right round and go back, and then you will come to the Stag.
-Oh, we had been there, and didn’t like it—no honeysuckle over it.
-Well, then,
-there’s the Manor House, just opposite. Have you tried that?
-Well, I don’t know what you’ll do, I’m sure,
-because they are the only two inns in the place.
-No other inns!
-None,
-What on earth are we to do?
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Oh, good evening,
-we want three beds, please.
-Very sorry, sir,
-but I’m afraid we can’t manage it.
-Oh, well, never mind,
-two will do. Two of us can sleep in one bed, can’t we?
-Oh, yes;
-Very sorry, sir,
-but we really haven’t got a bed vacant in the whole house. In fact, we are putting two, and even three gentlemen in one bed, as it is.
-Oh, well, we can’t help it. We must rough it. You must give us a shake-down in the billiard-room.
-Very sorry, sir. Three gentlemen sleeping on the billiard-table already, and two in the coffee-room. Can’t possibly take you in to-night.
-Oh, yes,
-Well, if we didn’t mind roughing it—she did not recommend it, mind—but there was a little beershop half a mile down the Eton road—
-little place
-Crown.
-from the times of King Sebert and King Offa.
-Hell Fire Club,
-Do as you please,
-Poor Pussy!
-Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come to take me away from this disgraceful scene!
-Yes! You want me?
-Can I do anything for you?
-No—no, thanks.
-Don’t you mind speaking, if you really want anything, you know.
-Oh, no—not at all—certainly—don’t you trouble. I—I am afraid I’ve made a mistake. I thought I knew you. Sorry I disturbed you.
-Not at all—quite a pleasure. Sure you don’t want anything, now?
-Not at all, thanks—not at all—very kind of you. Good morning.
-Good-morning.
-Cats!
-Please don’t.
-Yes, sir, I will send them off at once: the boy will be down there before you are, sir!
-Let me see, sir; was yours a steam-launch or a house-boat?
-justifiable homicide
-Steam launch, coming!
-Why, George, bless me, if here isn’t a steam launch!
-Well, do you know, I _thought_ I heard something!
-Pull your right—you, you idiot! back with your left. No, not _you_—the other one—leave the lines alone, can’t you—now, both together. NOT _that_ way. Oh, you—!
-Oh, please could you spare us a little water?
-Certainly,
-take as much as you want, and leave the rest.
-Thank you so much,
-Where—where do you keep it?
-It’s always in the same place my boy,
-just behind you.
-I don’t see it,
-Why, bless us, where’s your eyes?
-There’s enough of it to see, ain’t there?
-Oh!
-but we can’t drink the river, you know!
-No; but you can drink _some_ of it,
-It’s what _I’ve_ drunk for the last fifteen years.
-What’s that?
-What’s what?
-Why that!
-Oh, no;
-Have you got a spoon there?
-I want a spoon to help the gravy with.
-Has he been snatched up to heaven?
-They’d hardly have taken the pie too,
-I suppose the truth of the matter is,
-that there has been an earthquake.
-I wish he hadn’t been carving that pie.

-Oh, don’t be a stupid ass!

-Did what?

-If you never try a new thing, how can you tell what it’s like? It’s men such as you that hamper the world’s progress. Think of the man who first tried German sausage!
-Ah! would ye!

-What’s he want to howl like that for when I’m playing?
-What do you want to play like that for when he is howling?
-You let him alone. He can’t help howling. He’s got a musical ear, and your playing _makes_ him howl.

-Oh! I remember now,

-Swans!
-How many swans did you say there were?
-Thirty-two,
-You said eighteen just now,
-No, I didn’t,
-I said twelve. Think I can’t count?
-What swans?

-Fancy old George talking about work!
-why, about half-an-hour of it would kill him. Have you ever seen George work?
-Well, I don’t see how _you_ can know much about it, one way or the other,
-for I’m blest if you haven’t been asleep half the time. Have you ever seen Harris fully awake, except at meal-time?
-Well, hang it all, I’ve done more than old J., anyhow,
-Well, you couldn’t very well have done less,
-I suppose J. thinks he is the passenger,
-Call what you’re doing hard work!
-why, Jim Biffles and Jack and I, last season, pulled up from Marlow to Goring in one afternoon—never stopped once. Do you remember that, Jack?

-Bull,
-a good station for fishing;
-jack and perch are also to be had about here,
-had
-Oh, I caught fifteen dozen perch yesterday evening;
-Last Monday I landed a gudgeon, weighing eighteen pounds, and measuring three feet from the tip to the tail.
-Well, I had a haul on Tuesday evening that it’s not much good my telling anybody about.
-Oh! why’s that?
-Because I don’t expect anybody would believe me if I did,
-No,
-I shouldn’t believe it myself if anybody told it to me, but it’s a fact, for all that. I had been sitting there all the afternoon and had caught literally nothing—except a few dozen dace and a score of jack; and I was just about giving it up as a bad job when I suddenly felt a rather smart pull at the line. I thought it was another little one, and I went to jerk it up. Hang me, if I could move the rod! It took me half-an-hour—half-an-hour, sir!—to land that fish; and every moment I thought the line was going to snap! I reached him at last, and what do you think it was? A sturgeon! a forty pound sturgeon! taken on a line, sir! Yes, you may well look surprised—I’ll have another three of Scotch, landlord, please.
-Oh, no; not now, sir. It did used to knock me over a bit at first, but, lor love you! me and the missus we listens to ’em all day now. It’s what you’re used to, you know. It’s what you’re used to.
-When I have caught forty fish,
-then I will tell people that I have caught fifty, and so on. But I will not lie any more than that, because it is sinful to lie.
-Ah!
-fine fellow that, ain’t he?
-Quite uncommon,
-Eighteen pounds six ounces,
-it wur sixteen year ago, come the third o’ next month, that I landed him. I caught him just below the bridge with a minnow. They told me he wur in the river, and I said I’d have him, and so I did. You don’t see many fish that size about here now, I’m thinking. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night.
-Good-sized trout, that,
-Ah! you may well say that, sir,
-Maybe you wasn’t here, sir, when that fish was caught?
-No,
-Ah!
-then, of course, how should you? It was nearly five years ago that I caught that trout.
-Oh! was it you who caught it, then?
-Yes, sir,
-I caught him just below the lock—leastways, what was the lock then—one Friday afternoon; and the remarkable thing about it is that I caught him with a fly. I’d gone out pike fishing, bless you, never thinking of a trout, and when I saw that whopper on the end of my line, blest if it didn’t quite take me aback. Well, you see, he weighed twenty-six pound. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night.
-I beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive the liberty that we—perfect strangers in the neighbourhood—are taking, but my friend here and myself would be so much obliged if you would tell us how you caught that trout up there.
-Why, who told you I caught that trout!
-Well, it’s a most remarkable thing—most remarkable,
-because, as a matter of fact, you are quite right. I did catch it. But fancy your guessing it like that. Dear me, it’s really a most remarkable thing.
-Fancy Jim Bates and Joe Muggles and Mr. Jones and old Billy Maunders all telling you that they had caught it. Ha! ha! ha! Well, that is good,
-Yes, they are the sort to give it _me_, to put up in _my_ parlour, if _they_ had caught it, they are! Ha! ha! ha!
-You haven’t injured the fish, have you?
-I hope not,
-Hi! look at your nose.
-Look at your nose, you stupid ass!
-Push your nose out, can’t you, you—you two with the dog!
-Look at your boat, sir; you in the red and black caps. It’s your two corpses that will get taken in that photo, if you ain’t quick.
-Where am I? and what is it?
-the city on the water.
-Barley Mow.

-Pride of the Thames.
-Oh, yes; you’re the party that wrote for a double sculling skiff. It’s all right. Jim, fetch round _The Pride of the Thames_.
-Come, come, my lad!
-don’t let us have any nonsense. You take your mother’s washing-tub home again, and bring us a boat.

-It’s only two days more,
-and we are young and strong. We may get over it all right, after all.
-Another jolly evening!
-Why, the Alhambra would be almost more lively,
-With a little supper at the --- {311} to follow,
-Yes it’s almost a pity we’ve made up our minds to stick to this boat,
-If we _hadn’t_ made up our minds to contract our certain deaths in this bally old coffin,
-it might be worth while to mention that there’s a train leaves Pangbourne, I know, soon after five, which would just land us in town in comfortable time to get a chop, and then go on to the place you mentioned afterwards.
